## About `!admin` commands

 Utilizing the bot to configure and manage your gameserver(s) has never been easier, and nearly all management tasks can be handled directly from Discord without the need to access the Nitrado.net webinterface.

> + In order to utilize the Admin module commands you will be required to have the `Killfeed Admin` role assigned within the Discord server the bot is setup in. Otherwise, these commands will not work upon invokes and will respond with an error message informing the user they do not have the necessary permissions.

!!!usage
All of the commands within this module will be prefixed by `!admin` followed by subcommand afterwards. Whereas, `info` would be the subcommand example shown below:

```log

Example: `!admin info`

```

!!! note
The `!help admin` command will provide an embedded response providing additional information on command options available any required/optional arguments that can be passed during the command execution.

```log

!help admin

```
